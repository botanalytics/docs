On the Y-axis, you have a list of communication channels and integration channels, including:

- Facebook Messenger

These represent the mediums through which users interact with the chatbot.

The X-axis represents the number of messages sent or received by each specific channel or integration platform. It's a quantitative measure, typically showing message counts.

### Horizontal Bar Graph

Each channel or integration platform is represented as a horizontal bar in the graph. The length or height of each bar corresponds to the number of messages associated with that channel during the current week. Longer bars indicate a higher volume of messages for that specific channel or platform.
