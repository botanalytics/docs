It provides a dynamic view of how different campaigns have performed in attracting and introducing users to the chatbot. Here's an explanation of the key elements and significance of an Acquisition Campaign Trends Graph:

### Key Elements

The y-axis of the graph represents the number or percentage of users acquired through different marketing campaigns during each time period.

#### Multiple Lines or Bars
