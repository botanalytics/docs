## Flows Sunburst

A flows sunburst graph for a chatbot is a visual representation that displays the hierarchical structure of a chatbot's conversation components, including intents, chatbot actions, events/composite events, fallback, exit points (when users leave the conversation due to non-completed tasks), escalation, and built-in events (such as "message delivered" and "message read"). It takes the form of a sunburst, which consists of concentric rings radiating outward from a central point, each representing a level of hierarchy within the chatbot's conversation. Here's how to interpret and understand a flows sunburst graph in the context of a chatbot:


Here's how to interpret and understand the sunburst graph in the context of a chatbot

### Hierarchy Visualization

The sunburst graph organizes chatbot conversation elements in a hierarchical manner, with the central point representing the root of the hierarchy and the outer rings representing different levels of conversation elements.

### Nodes and Rings

Each ring in the sunburst graph represents a level of the conversation hierarchy, and nodes are placed within these rings to represent specific conversation elements.

### Central Node

The central node typically represents the starting point of a conversation or a general context.

### Outer Rings

As you move outward from the central node, each ring corresponds to a more specific level of the conversation. For example, the first outer ring might contain nodes representing high-level intents, the next ring might contain nodes representing chatbot actions, and so on.

### Nodes and Segments

Nodes within each ring are arranged as segments, and their size can represent various attributes, such as the frequency of use, importance, or relevance.

### Colors and Labels

Different colors and labels are used to distinguish between the types of conversation elements, such as intents, actions, events/composite events, fallback, exit, escalation, and built-in events. These visual cues help users understand the composition of the chatbot's conversation.

### Interpreting a Sunburst Graph for a Chatbot

#### Hierarchy of Conversation

The sunburst graph provides a clear visual representation of how different conversation elements are organized within the chatbot's interactions. Users can see the hierarchy of intents, actions, events, and other elements from the central node to the outer rings.

#### Relative Importance

The size or prominence of nodes within each ring can indicate the relative importance or frequency of usage of specific conversation elements. Larger nodes may represent more significant intents or actions.

#### Flow of Conversation

By following the segments from the central node outward, users can track the flow of a conversation as it progresses through different intents, actions, events, and potential exit points.

#### Event-Driven Behavior

The sunburst graph can highlight how events, both user-generated and system-generated, influence the flow and direction of the conversation. It allows for a visual understanding of event-driven behavior.

### Use Cases for Sunburst Graph Analysis

#### Conversation Structure Optimization

Designers and developers can use the sunburst graph to optimize the structure and hierarchy of a chatbot's conversation, ensuring it aligns with user needs and goals.

#### Identifying Exit Points

The graph can help identify common exit points where users leave the conversation due to non-completed tasks, enabling improvements in user engagement and task completion.

#### Event-Driven Insights

Analysis of the graph can provide insights into how events, including user-generated and system-generated events, impact the chatbot's conversation flow and responses.

#### Visualizing Composition

The sunburst graph visually represents the composition of the chatbot's interactions, allowing stakeholders to grasp the complexity and diversity of conversation elements.

In summary, a sunburst graph for a chatbot offers a unique visual perspective on the chatbot's conversation hierarchy, composition, and flow. It is particularly valuable for understanding how different elements, including intents, actions, events/composite events, and exit points, are structured and interact within the chatbot's interactions. This visualization aids in conversation design, optimization, and the identification of event-driven patterns.
