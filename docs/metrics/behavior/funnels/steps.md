## Funnel Steps

A Funnel Steps graph for a chatbot, where nodes represent intents, events/composite events (including special types that could be part of sentences or compositions), and built-in events, is a visual representation that tracks and illustrates the sequential stages of a user's journey within a chatbot interaction. It helps in understanding how users progress through various steps or interactions within the chatbot conversation.

### Understanding the Concept

The Funnel Steps graph displays a series of sequential steps from left to right, representing different stages of the chatbot interaction. Each step corresponds to a specific interaction point or milestone.

### Key Elements

#### Sequential Progression

Users enter the funnel at the top and proceed through each step until they reach a final goal or complete a specific task. The funnel shape illustrates the decreasing number of users at each subsequent step.

#### Step Labels

Each step is labeled to describe the action or event that occurs at that stage, such as "User Initiation," "Intent Recognition," "Action Execution," "Event Handling," and "Conversation End."

#### Node Types

Nodes within each step represent different conversation elements, including:
- **Intents:** Represent the user's purpose or request.
- **Events/Composite Events:** Capture significant interactions or triggers, including special types that may be part of sentences or compositions.
- **Built-In Events:** System-generated events sent by the chatbot platform, such as "message delivered" or "message read."

### Analyzing the Funnel

#### Funnel Width

The width of the funnel at each step indicates the number of users who have reached that specific stage. Typically, the initial step is the widest, and subsequent steps become narrower as users progress or drop off.

#### Drop-Offs

Narrowing funnel width highlights where users are dropping off or not continuing to the next stage. Identifying drop-off points is crucial for optimizing user engagement and task completion.

#### Conversion Rate

Conversion rates between steps are calculated to assess the percentage of users who successfully move from one step to another. This metric helps evaluate the chatbot's effectiveness in guiding users through the interaction.

### Interpreting the Funnel Steps Graph

#### User Journey Analysis

The graph visually represents the user's journey within the chatbot conversation, showing how they progress from one step to another.

#### Drop-Off Identification

Pinpointing where users are leaving the conversation or encountering issues helps optimize the chatbot's design and user experience.

#### Conversion Rate Insights

Analyzing conversion rates provides insights into the chatbot's performance in guiding users to complete specific tasks or reach predefined goals.

### Practical Applications

#### Task Completion Optimization

Improving user engagement and increasing task completion rates by refining chatbot strategies based on the Funnel Steps graph.

#### User Experience Enhancement

Identifying drop-off points allows for targeted improvements in the conversation flow, content, and user experience.

#### Goal Achievement Tracking

Measuring the success of specific goals or conversions, such as form submissions or information retrieval, using the Funnel Steps graph.

#### Conversion Rate Optimization

Refining chatbot strategies to maximize user success in achieving desired actions by analyzing conversion rates.

### Summary

In summary, a Funnel Steps graph for a chatbot provides a visual representation of the user journey within the chatbot interaction. It offers valuable insights for improving the chatbot's design, user engagement, and task completion rates.
