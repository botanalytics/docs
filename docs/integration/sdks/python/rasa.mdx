# Rasa

This section describes how to integrate a Rasa integration channel with Botanalytics.

<V3Warning />

## Integration

Integrating Botanalytics into your Rasa application is quick and easy.

### Integration Options

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="endpoints" label="Endpoints.yml">

Add Botanalytics to your endpoints.yml

Add a line to your endpoints.yml so that rasa-core is configured to send events to Botanalytics:

```yaml
event_broker:
  type: botanalytics.rasa.Rasa
  api_key: BOTANALYTICS_API_KEY
```


</TabItem>

<TabItem value="eventbroker" label="Event Broker">

<a target="\_blank" href="https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/event-brokers/">Rasa Event Brokers</a> api produces a message onto a message broker, which is then used to consume the event. In the message broker consumer code, import our python library:


Include Botanalytics

```py
from botanalytics.rasa import Rasa
```

Then, use our library to publish events as part of your consumer code. As suggested below, call the Botanalytics rasa code with your api key in place of BOTANALYTICS_API_KEY. The example code below is for consuming rabbitmq messages via <a target="\_blank" href="https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pika</a>.


Consume events with Botanalytics

```py
def _callback(ch, method, properties, body):
  event = json.loads(body)
  db = Rasa(api_key=BOTANALYTICS_API_KEY)
  db.publish(event)
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
