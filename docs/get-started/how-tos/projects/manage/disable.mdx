   - A prompt will pop up, asking you to confirm if you want to disable the project and stop receiving updates.

You have successfully disabled the project in Botanalytics.
The Project will no longer receive updates or new data. The Disabled Project will be displayed at the bottom of the projects dashboard.
Please note that disabling a project will stop it from receiving updates, and you will not be able to view new data associated with that project. The project will still be listed in your account, but it will be inactive until you choose to [enable it again.](/docs/basics/how-tos/projects/enable)
