# Funnels

# What are funnels?

A funnel in the context of a chatbot is a visual representation of the conversation flow or logic, where nodes represent different elements of the chatbot's interaction. Steps represent intents, events/composite events (including special types that could be part of sentences or compositions), and built-in events, is a visual representation that tracks and illustrates the sequential stages of a user's journey within a chatbot interaction. It helps in understanding how users progress through various steps or interactions within the chatbot conversation.


## Node Types

Within each step, nodes represent different conversation elements. These nodes can include

### Intents

Represent the user's purpose or requests

### Events/Composite Events

Capture significant interactions or triggers, including special types that may be part of sentences or compositions.

### Built-In Events

Represent system-generated events sent by the chatbot platform, such as "message delivered" or "message read."
