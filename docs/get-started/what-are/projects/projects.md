# Projects

# What are projects?

Projects are like organized spaces where we can manage and analyze the performance of our conversational agent. They provide a dedicated area within the our platform for focused analytics efforts.

# For example 

An International company can create different projects to effectively manage their chatbots for different markets, they create a seperate project for each market they operate in, the chatbots under these projects would also have different languages to reflect the market which they operate under. These projects allow them to track the  performance of chatbots in each market to make improvements based on the data from each market respectively and ensures that their customers receive the best assistance and information from the chatbots based on the data.


# Importance of projects

Projects help us organize and streamline our analytics efforts. They allow us to group related project channels together, access specific data and insights for each project, and compare channel performances within the context of their respective projects.
