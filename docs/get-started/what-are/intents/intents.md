# Intents

# What are intents?

Intents are like the goals or purposes behind what you say to a chatbot. When you engage in a conversation with a virtual agent, it tries to figure out what you're asking or what you need help with. Intents represent the basic intentions or objectives of your message. 

Conversational agent systems built with NLP mostly have intent mapping of any sentence.
