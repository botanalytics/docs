Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs, which are understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your secret API token in any public website\'s client-side code). JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration/no-code/facebook-messenger":{"id":"integration/no-code/facebook-messenger","title":"Facebook Messenger","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration/overview":{"id":"integration/overview","title":"Overview","description":"This section is written to guide you through integration steps for the channel of your choice.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"integration/rest-api":{"id":"integration/rest-api","title":"REST API","description":"Checkout out the Botanalytics Postman documentation.

These APIs can be accessed programmatically but they can also be incredibly useful for manual debugging. This process of manual debugging can be very time-consuming though. To help developers interact with our Botanalytics APIs we\'ve recently created a workspace on Postman that comes with all of our API endpoints pre-filled.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"support":{"id":"support","title":"Support","description":"Join the Community","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
